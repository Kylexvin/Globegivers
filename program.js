                <p>Many families on Mfangano Island lack access to clean water and depend on the heavily polluted Lake Victoria. Our Community Water Project addresses this critical issue by establishing clean water collection points throughout the island.</p>
                <p>Clean water is essential for health, education, and economic development. When communities have reliable access to safe water, children spend less time collecting water and more time in school, waterborne illnesses decrease, and overall quality of life improves.</p>
                <p>We have established a clean water collection point serving up to 5,000 people daily. Our goal is to expand access and reduce long-distance water collection through additional collection points and improved infrastructure.</p>
